If worldPath cannot find a valid path, have it call itself and pass an argument indicating that the area to search within should be
increased. This area takes the shape of a flat parallelogram that is parallel with the line between start and end nodes. This
value typically starts low so that the worldPath only tries to path within a narrow "road". If the pathfinding fails, this road
becomes thicker with each failed worldPath call. If the argument is too large, worldPath will do an unbounded search instead. This
should keep the common case fast.
