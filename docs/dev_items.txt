Because the game infrequently adds or removes creatures from a collection, but must access them frequently, I will store 
creatures in an array. For simplicity, I will first use one array for player creatures and one for enemy creatures. 

Try having the universal game clock be a long long number counting up in real time. Have one thread updating this clock, and the 
main game thread passing a pointer to this clock to all objects that move in real time. For example, a collection of creatures
would read from the clock when deciding on which frame to do some time-sensitive action. The "clock" thread should count upwards
in milliseconds (or probably a larger increment).

Don't implement a body part system to start; just give creatures HP. Defenses and resistances are not stored values, but functions
of the armor, status effects, and eventually, body parts.

Attack power (for simple HP implementation) is a function of weapon attributes and the attackers mental attributes (that may 
cause them to hit or miss).
