Nurgul/Arc the Blood

Synopsis: Nurgul/Arc the Blood is a strategy RPG centered on handcrafted  maps rather than procedurally-generated maps. It also focuses
on somewhat deep simulation of combat interactions, body parts, health, crafting medicine/food/ammo/items, mental state, etc. Its default 
world is somewhat themed around NES/SNES Final Fantasy, LotR, Castlevania, and D&D, but the project will provide tools for modders to 
create their own vision on top of the tactical/physics/crafting engine base.

Demo map: A stone dungeon would be a good scenario for a demo map. The player can trade with adventurers and wandering merchants within
the dungeon. They can also pay an adventurer/merchant to "introduce" them to a new party member (through a character creator); a few 
days after the deal is made, the new party member will appear on the map and path towards the party.
